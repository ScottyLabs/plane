<p>Thank you for joining us at Portfolio Development Friday! We hope you got your portfolio website off the ground and had a great time.</p>

<p>Since this was the first iteration of PDF, we'd love to <a href="https://go.scottylabs.org/pdf-feedback">get some quick feedback</a> on the event so we can work on improving it for next year.</p>

<p>If you had a great time, and are interested in contributing to events like PDF, <a href="https://tartanhacks.org">TartanHacks</a>, and more, you should check out <a href="https://scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs!</a>
