<h1 style="font-size:24px">Hi everyone!</h1>
<br />

<p>It is time to elect a new exec board for ScottyLabs. In case you didn't know, ScottyLabs elects a new exec board each year based on nominations from all core members. Thank you in advance for reading this long email, it has a lot of important information about elections!</p>
<p>You can nominate anyone, including yourself, for any exec board position(s). Who the nominations are from will be anonymous to everyone but myself, Mayank Jain. <b>Please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/MJcn2sViCpj9S2wy5">this nominations form</a> before Sunday 03/29/20 at 9:00pm EDT.</b> After this deadline, I will be contacting people who were nominated for positions, and they may choose to accept any/all of their nominations up until Tuesday, 03/31/20 at 9:00pm EDT. <b>Elections will take place on Wednesday 04/01/20 at 9:00pm EDT over Zoom (<a href="https://cmu.zoom.us/j/412886695">https://cmu.zoom.us/j/412886695</a>).</b> If some nominee cannot make it to the Zoom meeting, they will be able to submit a 2 minute video explaining why they are a good fit for the position(s) they were nominated for.</p>
<p>The positions on the exec board are the same as last year. Feel free to reach out to one of the current directors if you want to learn more about the day-to-day work of their role. <a href="mailto:sayanc@andrew.cmu.edu">Sayan</a> is the Director, <a href="mailto:jbdurham@andrew.cmu.edu">Josh</a> is the Director of Finance, <a href="mailto:mayankj@andrew.cmu.edu">I</a> am the Director of Events, <a href="mailto:arjain@andrew.cmu.edu">Akshath</a> is the Director of Operations, <a href="mailto:rwguo@andrew.cmu.edu">Richard</a> is the Director of Technology, and <a href="mailto:mwbecker@andrew.cmu.edu">Michael</a> is the Director of Design.

<p>Running an exec board position may sound intimidating, but have confidence in yourself! To quote Mark Vella (Director of ScottyLabs 2015-2016): "The question you need to ask yourself is 'Am I so passionate about ScottyLabs that I'd like to take charge and direct the future of this organization?' All other questions can be answered in due time." Furthermore, all previous exec board members will support you so that whoever fills each position succeeds. We and the rest of ScottyLabs have got your back!</p>
